# Community Blocklist (`community/`)

> **⚠️ Research Dataset — Not for Direct Production Blocking**
>
> This list is an **auto-aggregated collection** of phishing / scam domains from multiple public threat intelligence sources and our own detections. It is primarily intended for **research**, phishing pattern analysis, and ML model training.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Aggregate phishing / scam domains from multiple community feeds.
- Help researchers analyze domain abuse and phishing patterns at scale.
- Provide material for **passive** detection solutions (AI/ML models, heuristic rules).
- **Does not block domains or affect availability** — being listed here has no operational impact.

---

## 🛠️ How It’s Built

- Generated by root script: `smart_aggregator.py`
- **Inputs:** our local `list.json` + community feeds (see [Sources](#-sources))
- **Output:** `community/blocklist.json` + stats and change metadata
- **Optional:** Run `community/dns_validator.py` for DNS resolution check → produces:
  - `live_blocklist.json` — resolvable domains
  - `dead_blocklist.json` — non-resolving domains
  - `dns_cache.json` — cached lookups
  - `live_count.json` — number of live domains

## 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `blocklist.json` | Merged & normalized community domains |
| `state.json` | Per-source hash + counts |
| `count.json` | Total count badge JSON |
| `commit_message.txt` | Auto commit message |
| `dns_cache.json` | Cached DNS lookups |
| `live_blocklist.json` / `dead_blocklist.json` | DNS split output |
| `live_count.json` | Number of live domains |

---

## 🚦 Policy

- **No manual removals.** The list is fully automated. Manual edits would be overwritten on the next sync.
- If you believe a domain should be removed, submit a request to the **original source feed** — once removed there, it will disappear from this list on the next update.
- For lower false positives in production, use the **curated list** instead of this community dataset.
