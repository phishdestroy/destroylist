## ⚠️ Research Dataset — Not for Direct Production Blocking

Auto-aggregated collection of phishing/scam domains from **35+ public threat intelligence sources**. 

Intended for **research**, pattern analysis, and ML model training.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Aggregate domains from multiple community feeds
- Analyze domain abuse and phishing patterns at scale
- Train AI/ML models and heuristic detection systems
- **No operational impact** — being listed here doesn't block anything

---

## 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `blocklist.json` | Merged & normalized domains |
| `live_blocklist.json` | DNS-verified (resolvable) |
| `dead_blocklist.json` | Non-resolving domains |
| `state.json` | Per-source hash & counts |
| `count.json` | Total count for badges |
| `live_count.json` | Live domain count |
| `dns_cache.json` | Cached DNS lookups |

---

## 🚦 Policy

- **No manual removals** — fully automated, edits get overwritten
- To remove a domain → report to the **original source feed**
- For production use → prefer the curated `list.json` instead

## 🛠️ How It's Built

Generated by `smart_aggregator.py`:

1. Fetches from all source feeds
2. Normalizes and deduplicates
3. Outputs `blocklist.json` + metadata

Optional DNS validation via `dns_validator.py`:

```powershell
py smart_aggregator.py
py community\dns_validator.py --workers 200
```
